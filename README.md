# An anxiety's guide to paranoid cybersafety
I'm anxious about how I present online, and I recently have been approached by people making alts online a lot. So, I compiled together a couple of internet resources and personal experiences to create a beginner's guide of sorts. **This guide is intended for users who want to make it difficult to be tracked or found on the internet** and is not meant for the average user that has nothing to worry about.

**I am not the most professional at cybersecurity and safety on the internet**, so take some of these sections with a grain of salt. This advice may or may not work, and might even make things worse than they might help.

## Disclaimer
This guide is a very surface level thing and assumes that you have already taken the appropiate steps. You should still be screenshotting all messages you receive as-is and contact your local police department for further advice and help. This guide also assumes you are willing to do **anything** to stay safe, including giving up platforms you may not easily be able to let go.
