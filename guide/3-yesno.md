# 3. Do's and Dont's
Now that we established some basic advice, let's go through some Do's and Don'ts that will help you a lot throughout your journey.

## Do...
* Be careful who you add.

If your gut says that if you add this person, that something sketchy might go on later down the line, listen to that gut and do not interact!  
Noted, your gut may not always be right, but in at least one case, you will be right, so if you get a sketchy vibe or get anxious reading something that seems wrong, it probably *is* wrong.


## DON'T...
* Do not acknowledge your stalker. Block and move on.

Giving attention to your cyberstalker may encourage them to keep going. Granted, sometimes doing nothing won't always make them go away as easily, but it's the right thing you should be doing. Ragebaiting your stalker will just make them angrier, and they'll go after you more.

If they threaten violence or claim they have something on you, you should seek police help **as soon as you can**.

* Reuse the same username for every website.

You know how some people will ask you to use the same username everywhere, so you can be found on other websites easier?  
Yeah, don't do that. That makes your digital footprint bigger, and one google search of your known username might be the difference between them finding very little or having a new account to go after.
