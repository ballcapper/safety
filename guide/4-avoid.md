# 4. Websites You Should Avoid
There are certain websites that do not have good controls. This section of the guide will explain some sites that have bad controls, and/or ESPECIALLY are hotspots for cyberharassment/cyberstalking.

It will be split in four sections:
- Little risk: Sites that have solid protections. Probably safe to keep going, but if you're smart, you'll also avoid these.
- Mild risk: There are small risks with using this site, but for the most part, it should be safe.
- Medium risk: There is potential for bad actors to wiggle out of
- DO NOT VISIT: Avoid this site, **especially** if you know your stalker has reached out through that site before.

Let's begin.

## Little risk
Sites where you have near zero risk if you play your cards right. If you can, continue to quit these, but if you absolutely cannot, use this as your bible.

**Steam**
> Steam is a gaming platform with millions of users daily. This site has *very* good safety features, including being able to hide your bio and real name to just friends and/or only yourself (the only information you can get out of this is a pic, your display name and a notice that says your profile is private), the ability to turn off profile comments, the ability to hide your gaming/online activity, and a very basic block feature. If you set profile comments to friends only, friends can write but everybody can view.
>
> The only information users can get is your profile picture, custom URL and display name **both logged in and out**. Everything else can be hidden accordingly, against the will of the user. Your Steam ID can be reversed.
>
> Steam does not have the ability to turn off friend requests, although to be added by a steam account, the account must have spent at least $5 USD, which reduces the chances of being added by a targetted alt down to slim to none. There is no way to embed images without being subject to Steam's moderation, though you should still be careful what profiles you open.

## Mild risk
Sites that have good safety controls for the most part, but still are potential vectors for attack, especially if you are reckless.

**Discord**
> Discord is a social platform and former gamer oriented chat application with millions of users daily. Discord has good safety features including a sensitive content blur filter for teen accounts, a block feature, **the ability to turn off friend requests**, the ability to turn off your online/game status, the ability to turn off direct messages from strangers and the ability to hide your online activity. Friends on Discord are also almost always hidden, except for "mutual friends".
>
> In the best case scenario, users can only obtain your profile picture, username and display name **only while logged in**. If you share mutual servers with the target, you can get additional information.
>
> Stay out of public servers and leave servers your stalker has been in. Discord may **also** be the source of trauma for some, and should probably be avoiding it if you are already scared of using it anyway.


## Medium risk
Sites that have lacking safety controls, and/or would have left you severely vulnerable, hadn't there at least be something.

**GitHub**
> GitHub is an online source code sharing and release management website. GitHub has a block feature and repo privating features.
>
> Users can get your profile picture, display name, username,  your bio, your links and other content **both logged in and out**. Email is an opt-in display. You can optionally opt-out of displaying contributions, followers, stars, releases and leaderboards. **Your repositories are always visible**.

## DO NOT VISIT
If you are being cyberstalked, AVOID THESE SITES. Their controls are second to none, and/or hotspots for cyberstalking with near no way to avoid it.

**SPACEHEY!!!**
> SpaceHey is an online MySpace-like platform with just over a million daily users. SpaceHey has a block feature, the ability to hide your profile nad the ability to limit private messages to friends only. Profile comments are always only writable by friends, but are visible to all users.
>
> SpaceHey has several vectors of attack (that should NOT be ignored), including friend requests, blog comments, bulletin comments, friends of friends and direct messages (assuming they are not Friends Only). All content is publically accessible on profiles with no alt/vpn detection, with the only options being "show to all" or "show to friends only".
>
> SpaceHey has also been a very big victim of gore raids, profiles with sexual content, and other content that should be avoided, no matter how much you want to use it. There is also divides in opinions with the userbase, and a lot of top posts tend to be drama filled.

**ROBLOX**
> ROBLOX is an online gaming platform with hundreds of millions of users daily. ROBLOX has a block feature and the ability to turn off your online status. ROBLOX also forcefully only allows you to receieve messages from friends in private (since the removal of Inbox), and hides messages from blocked users. Users can opt out of reading public chat messages for *everyone* with no toggle for specific users.
>
> Your bio and badge history is hidden while logged out. Users in the United Kingdom also has their friends hidden if you are not friended.
>
> ROBLOX has several flaws, including being unable to turn off friend requests (which can and has been used to harass before), being unable to turn off who can follow you, unable to hide the avatars of blocked users, and in general just poor user safety. These features have been abused before and ROBLOX is also a **very** big hub for predators. Do not fly.
