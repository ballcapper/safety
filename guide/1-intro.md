# 1. Introduction
Welcome to an overly paranoid guide about staying safe on the internet, even while being potentially followed. Keep in mind that this guide is not an alternative for legal advice, **you should first seek police help** alongside some of the tips in this guide.

For a lot of this guide, there will be tips presented that may seem too extreme or burdensome for some.

If you do not have that time (or simply do not want to go through all of this effort to avoid being harassed), at the bare minimum you should:
- Private and lock ALL of your social media accounts and turn off friend requests.
	- If you cannot private it, delete all of the posts/links to other socials/pictures on it and abandon it ASAP.
	- The best social medias will have controls for turning off new friend requests, hiding your friends and let you restrict messages to friends only. If you cannot do that, consider making a new one under a completely different name only you know about.
		- If you cannot hide your friends, consider just not friending your friends. That may be difficult on many game platforms.
		- More on that in the "sites you should avoid" section.
	- If you can go without it, that's even better.
- Use throwaway accounts on social media IF you need to reach out.
	- Reddit has a common throwaway culture, if you want to seek advice there. Remember to use a pre-generated username for the best advice.
- Avoid habits that you friends or stalker might recognize you by.
- Avoid sharing information about yourself publically, ESPECIALLY if it is trauma/trigger related and/or could track you back to your town.
	- ESPECIALLY never share photos of yourself.
- Reduce your [digital footprint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_footprint) as much as possible
	- Especially if you have before made questionable or potentially sensitive posts
- Keep a trusted friend or adult knowing what's happening as you go.

Without much word, let's begin.
