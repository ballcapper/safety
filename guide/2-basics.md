# 2. Basic Safety Tips
Let's look at some tips on how you can *actually* stay safe. Keep in mind that this advice is based on personal experience and might not work for all.

## General tips
- Close or delete accounts you haven't touched in months or more.
	- It's good to close accounts you don't use, especially if you are being followed.
	- Plus, it removes one thing from your footprint.
- Avoid reusing usernames.
	- The reason why you shouldn't do this is VERY obvious.
- 

## Discord users
- Avoid public Discord servers like the PLAGUE.
	- Medium to big servers are a hotspot for being stalked, even more as the member count is higher.
	- Also, by sitting in public Discord servers, you practically open your bio to being read. Any identifiable information or links = Vector of attack
	- If you use these servers for emojis, consider installing Vencord and cloning the emojis to a server you own with EmojiCloner.
- Turn off your friend requests and direct messages ENTIRELY.
- Consider using an account that has your friends added and joined in almost NO servers.
	- Some servers that should be okay to be in on this account include your friend group (assuming one of your friends aren't after you), private projects where you know the people and know your stalker cannot easily get an invite, etc.
